            <h1 id="bonus-assignment-implementing-convex-hull-algorithms">Bonus Assignment: Implementing Convex Hull Algorithms</h1>
<p>The main goal of the bonus project is to learn about the peculiarities
of implementing geometric algorithms. Furthermore, you may see that
there may be differences between theory and practice in terms of
performance of the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="the-assignment">The assignment</h2>
<p>In groups of two or three you will implement two or three algorithms
to compute the convex hull of a set of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> points in <span class="math inline">ℝ<sup>2</sup></span>,
and experimentally evaluate them. In case your group consists of three
people, implement (at least) three algorithms. For all algorithms, try
to find a “type” of data sets where this algorithm performs better
than the other algorithm(s). Finally, write a short, at most two
pages, paper/report about your findings.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithms">The algorithms</h2>
<p>The algorithms you can choose from are</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham Scan (the algorithm that we covered in detail in lecture
one),</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm">Jarvis March</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Spring16/Preparata77.pdf">Divide and Conquer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>or, if you like some additional challenge,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan's_algorithm">Chan’s Algorithm</a>
(see also <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02712873">the original paper</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h2>
<p>The most important aspect of your implementation is
<strong>correctness</strong>. That is, make sure that your algorithms <strong>always</strong>
produces the correct convex hull, even if the input is degenerate. For
example, if there may be three points on a line. Report only the
strictly convex vertices (i.e. at which the interior angle is strictly
less than <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>), and in clockwise order.</p>
<p>You will likely run in to an additional issue that, in the theory part
of the course, we mostly ignore. See for example what happens when all
input points are <strong>almost</strong> on a line. Think about a way to avoid this
issue, and state in your paper what you did to tackle it.</p>
<h2 id="the-experimental-setup">The Experimental Setup</h2>
<p>Briefly describe how you obtain/create the data sets you can evaluate
your algorithms on. Consider at least two different “types” ways of
creating data sets. In particular, for each algorithm <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, try to find
a “type” of data set for which it computes the convex hull faster than
the other algorithm(s). If for cannot find such a set for an algorithm
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, explain what you tried, and why you think the other algorithm
performs better than <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> on all your data sets.</p>
<p>Make sure to vary the number of points <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> in the input datasets, and
report the running time of the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="the-paperreport">The paper/report</h2>
<p>You will write a short, maximum two page, paper that states</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>which algorithms you implemented,</li>
<li>a very short description of the context (i.e. language and
environment) in which you implemented your algorithms and your
experimental setup,</li>
<li>how you made sure that your algorithms are guaranteed to be
correct,</li>
<li>your experimental results (in some easy to read way), and</li>
<li>a very short, one at most paragraph, conclusion with a
recommendation on which algorithm to use when.</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure it is well written, and has clear exposition of the data
sets and the results. Use figures, graphs, plots, etc. when
appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="the-assessment">The Assessment</h2>
<p>The assessment will be based on your paper/report only (but you may
have to provide your code on request). In particular, on</p>
<ul>
<li>how you made sure that your algorithms are correct,</li>
<li>how you evaluated your algorithms (i.e. which data sets did you
use/generate), and</li>
<li>the presentation of your experimental results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howwhen-to-hand-in-your-report">How/When to hand in your report</h2>
<p>Hand in your report on Brightspace by Fri 23 Jan 2025 23:59 (CET). You
may have to join a Group on Brightspace before you can see where to
hand it in.</p>
